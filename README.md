# Simple-GoLang-Blockchain

In this project I tried to make a very simple BlockChain
Actually can only support add blocks with some data and read the whole chain 

Eventualy I will improve this, adding addresses and wallets, for now I'm so happy with the results 

### Usage

To start you must to build the project, to do this just type 
```
go build main.go
```

Then, for use you can just type
```
./main [option]
```
Where option must be the option that you want
